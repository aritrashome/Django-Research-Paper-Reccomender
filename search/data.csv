The device  consists of several layers of flexible electronic components,  including  sensors  measuring  deformation  of  the  device.  Users  interact  with  this  device  by  a  combination  of  bending and 2D position control. Gummi explores physical  interaction  techniques  and  screen  interfaces  for  such  a  device. Its graphical user interface facilitates a wide range of  interaction tasks, focused on browsing of visual information.  We implemented both hardware and softwa",0,-4.282156479168512,-20,57,3

Introduction  The study of a number of well formulated but computationally massive problems is limited by the computing power of currently available or proposed computers. Some involve manipulations of very large matrices  e.g., linear programming   others, the solution of sets of partial differential equations over sizable grids  e.g., weather models   and others require extr",1,-1000.0,-1000,55,3
